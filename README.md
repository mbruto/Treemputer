<h2> Imputation of missing distances in Supertree matrices </h2>

<p> Treemputer is a mathod allowing the reconstruction of Supertree. It takes multiple source trees as input and perform the following steps :
   - Create a sparse distance matrix for all species present in the source tree. Distances of the matrix correspond to the mean patristic distance.
   - Impute the missing distances based on known distances.
   - Output a complete matrix if the necessary conditions are respected.
